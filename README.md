# Mo Cuishle gh-pages

The *Mo Cuishle* website ist published with *gh-pages*. Former *Jekyll* theme [*Simplicity*](https://phlow.github.io/simplicity/) by [*Phlow*](https://phlow.de/) is migrated to *[MDwiki (forked 0.6.x)](https://github.com/ganskef/mdwiki#mdwiki-v06x-forked)* for simplicity, security and by personal preference. I like the clean UI and especially the feature to include existing Markdown files.

The `gh-pages` branch contains *[MDwiki](https://ganskef.github.io/mdwiki/#!quickstart.md)* (the `index.html`) a self contained JavaScript application exposing Markdown files. It depends on `index.md`, optional `navigation.md` and `config.json`. That's it!

Fixes [#2](https://github.com/ganskef/MoCuishle/issues/2)
