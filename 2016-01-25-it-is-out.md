# Mo Cuishle - It's out!

*Mo Cuishle* is pushed to GitHub. After a long weekend it's out finally.

All the time I'm short before the push something is happened. **Aaargh!** A lot 
of - the last: settings won't be removed from Firefox on deactivate/uninstall in 
the Android version. This was blocking the push at 2016-01-23. Now it's been 
fixed. But it's perfectly possible you try it and something fails. Please be 
generous and tell me about by an [issue](https://github.com/ganskef/MoCuishle/issues). 

A caching proxy is in my personal use for years. I'm traveling a lot and I love 
it. For my daughter for example it would be totally useless. Caused Java and 
iPhone :-), and more important, her main interests at the Internet are volatile, 
not cachable. I use *Mo Cuishle* on my notebook with *GNU/Debian* and *Mac OS X* 
and on a *KitKat* *Android 4.4* mobile phone. I've seen it on Android 4.1, on 
tablets, on Windows. **Update:** And now I'm happy with *Android 5+*, see this 
Netty issue [#4718](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4718).

This is my first blog experience too. It's not totally ready but a new week is 
beginning at work... So it is a good point in time for a break. I let it go.
