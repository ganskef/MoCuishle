All web pages you've seen on the Internet via HTTP or HTTPS will be available 
later to read them without having to remain connected.<br><a

*Mo Cuishle* provides your 
[browse history]({{ site.url }}/browse-history/) ordered by the last access, and 
an [outgoing history]({{ site.url }}/outgoing-history/) of the pages you've 
requested offline to reload if needed. Also a 
[full text search]({{ site.url }}/full-text-search/) over the cached web sites 
is included. The hosts requested in the last minute are listed and you can 
decide to [block or unblock]({{ site.url }}/block-unblock/) addresses on the 
fly. It's been used on *Linux*, *OS X* and *Windows*. Every platform with a 
[*Mozilla* browser]({{ site.url }}/mozilla-install/) and *Java* should work 
simply by installing the add-on. For 
[*Android* devices]({{ site.url }}/android-install/) it is provided by an app 
which launces the background service and installs the browser extension. This is 
a binary preview. I'm not ready to [go public]({{ site.url }}/license/) for now.

# The vision - Ideas behind

> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. — Leonardo da Vinci

However simplicity itself has many definitions. I think it has to be girl friend 
compatible. If I give it to here she should know what to do with it. (since she 
will never ask me for that)

The anchestor is 
[Andrew M. Bishop's WWWOFFLE](http://www.gedanken.org.uk/software/wwwoffle/). 
This great application is simple for a Unix guy thinking in C. I've used it on 
my laptop for years, but I'm a Java developer, and I've liked to use it with 
Android, so I've implemented it myself, simplified. 

The name *Mo Cuishle* comes from *Clint Eastwood*'s movie *Million Dollar Baby* 
of course. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Dollar_Baby): 
&#171;*Mo Chuisle* (spelled incorrectly in the film as "mo cuishle"): Irish for 
"my darling, and my blood" (literally, "my pulse")&#187;. There's room for 
interpretation a lot. 

# Features
