*Mo Cuishle* provides your 
[browse history](http://ganskef.github.io/MoCuishle/browse-history/) ordered by the last access, and an 
[outgoing history](http://ganskef.github.io/MoCuishle/outgoing-history/) of the pages you've requested offline to 
reload if needed. Also a [full text search](http://ganskef.github.io/MoCuishle/full-text-search/) over the cached 
web sites is included. The hosts requested in the last minute are listed and you 
can decide to [block or unblock](http://ganskef.github.io/MoCuishle/block-unblock/) addresses on the fly. It's 
been used on *Linux*, *OS X* and *Windows*. Every platform with a [*Mozilla* 
browser](http://ganskef.github.io/MoCuishle/mozilla-install/) and *Java* should work simply by installing the 
Add-on. For [*Android* devices](http://ganskef.github.io/MoCuishle/android-install/) it is provided by an app 
which launces the background service and installs the browser extension. This 
is a binary preview. I'm not ready to [go public](http://ganskef.github.io/MoCuishle/license/) for now.

# The vision - Ideas behind

> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. — Leonardo da Vinci

However simplicity itself has many definitions. I think it has to be girl friend 
compatible. If I give it to here she should know what to do with it. (since she 
will never ask me for that)

The anchestor is 
[Andrew M. Bishop's WWWOFFLE](http://www.gedanken.org.uk/software/wwwoffle/). 
This great application is simple for a Unix guy thinking in C. I've used it on 
my laptop for years, but I'm a Java developer, and I've liked to use it with 
Android, so I've implemented it myself, simplified. 

The name *Mo Cuishle* comes from *Clint Eastwood*'s movie *Million Dollar Baby* 
of course. From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Dollar_Baby): 
&#171;*Mo Chuisle* (spelled incorrectly in the film as "mo cuishle"): Irish for 
"my darling, and my blood" (literally, "my pulse")&#187;. There's room for 
interpretation a lot.
