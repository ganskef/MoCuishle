# Mo Cuishle (1.0)

All web pages you've seen on the Internet via HTTP or HTTPS will be available 
later to read them without having to remain connected.<br><a 
class="button info" href="2016-01-18-android-install.md">Android App</a>&nbsp;<a 
class="button info" href="2016-01-17-mozilla-install.md">Mozilla/Java</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;

*Mo Cuishle* provides your 
[browse history](2016-01-22-browse-history.md) ordered by the last access, and 
an [outgoing history](2016-01-21-outgoing-history.md) of the pages you've 
requested offline to reload if needed. Also a 
[full text search](2016-01-20-full-text-search.md) over the cached web sites 
is included. The hosts requested in the last minute are listed and you can 
decide to [block or unblock](2016-01-19-block-unblock.md) addresses on the 
fly. It's been used on *Linux*, *OS X* and *Windows*. Every platform with a 
[*Mozilla* browser](2016-01-17-mozilla-install.md) and *Java* should work 
simply by installing the add-on. For 
[*Android* devices](2016-01-18-android-install.md) it is provided by an app 
which launces the background service and installs the browser extension. This is 
a binary preview. I'm not ready to [go public](2016-01-16-license.md) for now.

## The vision - Ideas behind

> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. â€” Leonardo da Vinci

However simplicity itself has many definitions. I think it has to be girlfriend 
compatible. If I give it to here she should know what to do with it. (since she 
will never ask me for that)

The anchestor is 
[Andrew M. Bishop's WWWOFFLE](http://www.gedanken.org.uk/software/wwwoffle/). 
This great application is simple for a Unix guy thinking in C. I've used it on 
my laptop for years, but I'm a Java developer and I liked to use it on Android, 
so I've implemented it myself, simplified. 

The name *Mo Cuishle* comes from *Clint Eastwood*'s movie *Million Dollar Baby* 
of course. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Dollar_Baby): 
&#171;*Mo Chuisle* (spelled incorrectly in the film as "mo cuishle"): Irish for 
"my darling, and my blood" (literally, "my pulse")&#187;. There's room for 
interpretation a lot. 

## Features

**Would'nt it be great...**<br/>
**... to have your own Internet** with you, always without a cable, no WLAN or no cell available?<br/>
**... to find everything you've read** on the Internet for years on your mobile phone or notebook?<br/>
**... to search in full text indexed** like Google in the sites of your interest last time?<br/>
**... to sync between** your cell phone and your notebook without having to go into someone's cloud?<br/>
**... if you've really don't have to pay** to see content again you've seen before so often you like?<br/>
**... to define an Add blocker** definition for your own, directly by viewing the site, offline too?<br/>
**... to stop spreading information** a lot while using the modern Web 2.0 and social media sites?<br/>
**... to save traffic volume**, not a problem on desktop, but mobile it's another situation often?<br/>

All that *Mo Cuishle* aims to provide to you!
