This is the *Mo Cuishle* website published with *gh-pages*. Former *Jekyll* theme [*Simplicity*](http://phlow.github.io/simplicity/) by [*Phlow*](http://phlow.de/) is migrated to *[MDwiki](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/)* version [0.6.2](https://github.com/Dynalon/mdwiki/releases/tag/0.6.2) for simplicity, security and by personal preference. I like the clean UI and especially the feature to include existing Markdown files.
